# Pizza Identification App

Pizza identification application using OpenCV and Python to identify pixel color and shapes
<br><br>
Application was developed with an old resturant I worked for in mind.<br><br>
The idea was to make an app that could identify and log pizzas made at the restaurant when they came out of the oven using image processing.<Br><BR>
This will likely not work with just any pizzas as the topping amounts necessary for each pizza are recognized by the application, although I want to work on updating this to recognize more and more pizzas and from different restaurants.<BR><BR>
It can currently recognize 5 different 20" pizzas from Ian's Pizza.<br>
-Pepperoni<br>
-Cheese<br>
-Buffalo Chicken<br>
-Mac and Cheese <br>
-Pomodoro <br><br><br>
Future App Goals:<br>
-Adding a UI element<br>
-Adding more shape recognition for other photos to be used<br>
